# opendos-layer

openDOS Userland

#
This is an open source layer for DOS under the scope of Linux, FreeBSD and macOS.
With this userland we can manage the FreeDOS.

#
Functions already implemented:
- mac_requirements
- download_fdos
- download_brew
- create_docker
-  create_dockerfile
- mac_qemu
- freebsd_update
- linux_update
- unzip_fdos
- create_img
- iso_fdos
- boot_fdos
- menu_installable
- menu_vm
- do_virtualbox

###
These are the already implemented. We are trying to achieve an open source layer ready to boot under Linux, FreeBSD and macOS.
If you run this script under FreeBSD or Linux you need to choose carefully the functions. You can test them each function.

###
We are going to test them on a FreeBSD machine now. After fixing FreeBSD we ae going to fix Linux.
Tested on a macOS 10.15; built on macOS 10.15
